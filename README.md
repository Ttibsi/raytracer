# raytracer

A simple raytracer built following the
[Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
book as an experiment to get more familiar with working with c++ and building
a somewhat complete renderer.

You can get the output from this by running the following command:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 src/main.cpp -o test && ./test >> img.ppm && open img.ppm
```

This repo was developed while training at Double Negative.
